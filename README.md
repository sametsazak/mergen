# Mergen - MacOS Audit and Security Check Tool

Mergen is an open-source, native macOS application for auditing and checking the security of your Mac. It scans your system for security issues based on the [Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks), and checks various settings and configurations related to security and privacy.

## Installation and Usage

Mergen is an open-source project, and you can download the latest release binary from the GitHub repository or you can build yourself.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sametsazak/mergen.git
```

Open the Mergen.xcworkspace file in Xcode.

Build and run the project in Xcode.

### Usage

Once you have installed Mergen, you can launch the application and start checking the security issues. The application is user-friendly and easy to use. Follow the steps mentioned below to check the security issues:

- Launch the Mergen application.

- Choose a category and press the scan button to start the security check.

## Reporting

### HTML Report

The HTML export feature lets you quickly generate a professional-looking report of your scan results. This report includes all the details about the security checks performed, as well as any warnings or errors that were detected. You can share it with others for review or reference.

### JSON Export

The JSON export feature allows you to export the scan results in JSON format that other applications can quickly process. This is particularly useful if you need to integrate the results with other security tools or workflows. The JSON format provides a detailed breakdown of each security check, making it easy to identify areas requiring further attention.

```json
 {
    "status" : "Firewall is enabled.",
    "documentation" : "For more information on configuring your firewall, visit: https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT201642",
    "category" : "CIS Benchmark",
    "mitigation" : "Enabling and configuring the firewall helps prevent unauthorized access to your device and increases overall security. A properly configured firewall can block incoming connections and minimize the risk of unauthorized access.",
    "remediation" : "To enable and configure the firewall, go to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Firewall, click 'Turn On Firewall', and 'Firewall Options...' to block incoming connections.",
    "description" : "The firewall helps protect your device from unauthorized access. This check verifies if the firewall is enabled and configured correctly.",
    "severity" : "High",
    "name" : "Check Firewall Status",
    "docID" : 5
  }
  ```

## Challenges

Developing this application was a fun but challenging experience. Here's a rundown of the main problems I faced along the way:

1. Learning Swift and SwiftUI on the Fly

As a Python-savvy developer, I had to learn Swift and SwiftUI on the go while building Mergen. I had to learn Swift and SwiftUI while simultaneously developing Mergen. This learning curve was a unique challenge, as I had to familiarize myself with new programming languages. However, through dedication and perseverance, I managed to overcome some problems and, at least, created a simple version my ideas.

2. No Admin Rights? No Problem!

Mergen's all about security, so it needed access to system settings and configs. But getting admin rights or using sudo in a macOS app wasn't an option, which made some security checks a bit tricky. To work around this, I focused on checks that could run with just user rights, even if it meant sacrificing a few features.

3. Keeping the Code Simple and User-Friendly

In an effort to make Mergen as accessible as possible for users and contributors. This goal presented a challenge, as macOS has numerous versions, and not every module could be tested on each one. As a result, user feedback is vital for identifying and addressing any compatibility issues or limitations that may arise due to the differences in macOS versions. This feedback-driven approach allows Mergen to continuously improve and adapt to different environments.


## Contributing

Since I'm not an expert Swift developer, there might be some issues with the code but we welcome contributions from anyone interested in improving the security of Mac. If you are interested in contributing to the project, please follow these steps:

- Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.

- Create a new branch for your changes.

- Make your changes and write tests it.

- Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.

- Open a pull request and describe your changes in detail.
